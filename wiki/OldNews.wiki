====Nov. 14th 2008 ====
3.030 beta 2 (SVN r355) has been released for testing.  
The main reasons for this beta release is to let users test:
  * the fix for issue 165  (Chris does not own a guitar controller that exhibits this problem -- initial reports indicate that this problem has been solved).
  * the View thread timing changes made in r350 (Should result in major smoothness and stability improvements as well as mostly fixing[?] the double-loading screen issue).

Please post in the [http://www.fretsonfire.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=25040 FoFiX Development Thread] if you find that 3.030 beta 2 removes the requirement for XPadder or JoyToKey for those users that currently have to use these external applications.
