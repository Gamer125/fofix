3.100 Beta 3 (SVN r862) has been released for testing.  Big Rock Endings and Drum Fills have come further since 3.100 beta 2.  Guitar picks will now repeat for menu and songlist scrolling, and lyrics will no longer show during the song countdown.

3.100 Beta 2 (SVN r812) has been released for testing.  Big Rock Endings and Drum Fills have come much further since 3.100 beta 1, as has the settings menu.  No more double-and-triple song loading cycles, either.

_Coming soon - 3.100 beta 1 (that's right, we're skipping from 3.030 directly to 3.100.  There will be no 3.035... entirely too much progress has been made for such a minor version increment.  -Chris)_

3.035 Beta 2 (SVN r621) has been released for testing.  
I would write more, but I have to go.  Someone else can edit this later :)
(I also appear to have obliterated the beta 1 release news... I'll have to fix this later unless someone wants to take care of that for me - I forgot to paste into the oldnews, I'm a bit rushed as I have to leave in 5 minutes)

FoFiX has a new tutorial song, for a total of [http://fofix.googlecode.com/files/FoFiX-All4Tutorials.rar 4].  This new drum roll practice tutorial was created by venom426.

Warning: playing this tutorial song in a FoFiX revision below 548 can result in incorrect scoring due to drums allowing sustained notes.

====Nov. 14th 2008 ====
3.030 beta 2 (SVN r355) has been released for testing.  
The main reasons for this beta release is to let users test:
  * the fix for issue 165  (Chris does not own a guitar controller that exhibits this problem -- initial reports indicate that this problem has been solved).
  * the View thread timing changes made in r350 (Should result in major smoothness and stability improvements as well as mostly fixing[?] the double-loading screen issue).

Please post in the [http://www.fretsonfire.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=25040 FoFiX Development Thread] if you find that 3.030 beta 2 removes the requirement for XPadder or JoyToKey for those users that currently have to use these external applications.

3.030 beta 1 (SVN r277) has been released for testing.  It's main feature is that an old, outdated dependency on Amanith and pyAmanith has been removed; the full package is lighter, less support files and libraries (saved about 1MB).
