#summary How to get game controllers to work

= Introduction =
You own a Guitar Hero or Rock Band controller for the PS2, PS3, Wii or xbox360?
You are wondering how to get it to work? You are at the right place!

= Microsoft Windows =
== PS3 ==
Works right out of the box - just plug it in.  It uses the standard joystick driver that is part of Windows.

== PS2, Xbox 360, Wii ==
_Some knowledgeable Windows person, please fill this in._

= GNU/Linux =
== PS2 ==
Get your hands on a PS2 to USB adapter and it'll work out of the box.

== xbox360 ==
Depending on your distribution, it might work out of the box.
If it does not, install the [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/ xboxdrv driver].

*Note*: There are alternatives, like the xpad kernel module, but since the xboxdrv is a userspace kernel driver that works even with the most recent kernels with problematic Xorg !AutoAddDevices feature, we recommand that one.

= MacOS X =
== xbox360 ==
Install this [http://tattiebogle.net/index.php/ProjectRoot/Xbox360Controller/OsxDriver driver]. See the instructions on the driver page for more information.
