== Image and Text Positioning ==

In the FoFiX game engine, images are positioned by their exact center. Text is positioned by it's upper left corner, with a small margin.  

Also, text "Y" coordinates are scaled for the full pixel WIDTH, not height as one might expect.  Nothing surprising or strange about how images are handled.

(Example logic / code extract): surround two lines of already-positioned text with a background frame:
{{{

Tw, Th = soloFont.getStringSize(text1,txtSize)
Tw2, Th2 = soloFont.getStringSize(text2,txtSize)

#MFH - scale and display self.soloFrame behind / around the text
if self.soloFrame:
  frameWidth = (max(Tw,Tw2))*1.15
  frameHeight = (Th+Th2)*1.05
  boxXOffset = 0.5
  #MFH - font Y position = top of text to be written
  boxYOffset = self.hPlayer[i]-(self.wFull* (yOffset+(frameHeight/1.97)) )
  self.soloFrame.transform.reset()
  tempWScale = frameWidth*self.soloFrameWFactor
  tempHScale = -(frameHeight)*self.soloFrameWFactor
  self.soloFrame.transform.scale(tempWScale,tempHScale)
  self.soloFrame.transform.translate(self.wPlayer[i]*boxXOffset,boxYOffset)
  self.soloFrame.draw()

soloFont.render(text1, (0.5 - Tw/2, yOffset),(1, 0, 0),txtSize)   #centered
soloFont.render(text2, (0.5 - Tw2/2, yOffset+Th+txtSize),(1, 0, 0),txtSize)   #centered

}}}

*NOTE* - With the impending implementation of the Lamina library in 3.035, rendering text will make a LOT more sense!
