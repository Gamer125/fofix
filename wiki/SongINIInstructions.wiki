==Usable functions in the song.ini file.==

||_*SongINI Feature*_||_*Proper Usage*_||
||artist = .38 Special||Indicates that the artist is ".38 Special"||
||name = Hold On Loosely||Indicates that the song name is "Hold On Loosely"||
||tags = cover||Indicates that is not an original master. So it will show "As Made famous by" instead of "As performed by" at the beginning of the song.||
||unlock_id = gh80_3||For career mode, indicates the Tier it belongs to.||
||unlock_require = gh80_2enc||For career mode, indicates the unlock_id of the songs you have to complete to be able to play this song.||

||count = 1||How many times played||
||scores =||Encoded HighScores||
||scores_ext =||Also Encoded, contains other score info (longest note streak, etc)||
||tutorial =||Boolean value -- not checked, but chances are it tells the game not to display the song in the Set list if set to 1.||
||delay =||Not sure; IINM makes the notes appear earlier/later (depending on the value -- that could be set in ms but that's a random guess).||
||frets =||Name of the maker/converter of the song.||
||version = ||Show the version of the song.||
||year =||Year in which the song has been published/made. Place at the end of the list.||
||loading_phrase =||Should be put at the end of the file; displays a custom phrase (maybe more than 1, if separated by "_", but I haven't tested) on the loading screen, instead of the selected theme's default ones.||
