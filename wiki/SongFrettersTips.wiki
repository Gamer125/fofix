*Fretters' note on marking Overdrive and Starpower sections, with future Solo Section marking in mind*

I would highly recommend you create any Starpower sections as Overdrive sections, as FoFiX interprets them exactly the same.  Starpower sections would usually be marked on note G8; Overdrive sections are marked on G#9.  In Rock Band, solo sections are marked on G8.  

This means that if you mark starpower on G8, you will ONLY be able to designate GUITAR SOLOS using the old TEXT EVENT (GH1 style) or SECTION EVENT (original FoFiX RB1 style) methods.

That is why I recommend marking starpower or overdrive on G#9.  Then, should you decide later that you want to mark out some DRUM SOLOS or BASS SOLOS -- you will be able to add those on G8.  (will be supported in FoFiX soon!)
