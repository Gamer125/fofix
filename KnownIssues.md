# Introduction #
Most of the issues that are encountered can be found on the Issue Tracker. There are a few that many people ask about, so you can see those here.

# Excessive Framerate / FPS #

To anyone who's having a problem with too many frames per second being rendered, make sure the "FPS Limiter" is set to "On" in the Advanced Menu under "Display Settings".

# Won't Fix #
**NOTE** Our Issues Tracker contains both [enhancement requests, bugs and known issues](http://code.google.com/p/fofix/issues/list?can=2&q=type:Defect). Have a look! This list shows 'problems' that will not be fixed.

  * Guitar solos require an unbroken streak to get a 100% - even if you overstrum and hit all the notes, your guitar solo will be forced down to 99.0%. It's like this for a reason, and will probably not be fixed.
  * Scores are handicapped. This is in order to maintain some manner of parity across the wide variety of settings for people who upload their scores. Perhaps at some point a feature to better do this will be implemented, but until that time, this is how it is going to be.

## About Variable/Speed-dependent Hitwindow ##
Set the hitwindow to tight and tweak the A/V-Delay so it's right when you hit the notes when listening to the music. This is now easy with the new Accuracy indicator.
Remember that the correct A/V-Delay is different on every computer depending on system hardware and audio and video settings.

# Unconfirmed Bug Reports #
**NOTE** We have not been able to reproduce any of these, so to us, these bugs do not exist.

  * Every once in a while, [this](http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=24664;st=5120#entry313889) will happen (multiple game screens mixed together) - FoF isn't perfect (far from it), and it gets confused. Restart the game, you'll be fine.
