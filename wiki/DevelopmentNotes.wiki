This Wiki is probably only going to be of use to developers... 


== Toggling the Debug Layer ==
_In FoFiX's main menu_, pressing *ALT + D* will toggle the Debug Layer on and off.  This layer provides real-time information on the inner workings of FoFiX, and could be of use to some advanced developers.

This should be togglable anywhere; except that further layers of menus and UIs have their own keyListeners and the ALT-D doesn't seem to make it all the way out to the FretsOnFire.py code.  It does, however, work during gameplay (if you are not using "D" for any gameplay key) - you can toggle the debug layer on and off while playing the game.

Although this is probably simple to fix (passing ALT-Ds back to the main keyListener, for example), it is not necessary... toggle it on in the Main Menu and then go play and watch it.  Restart the game or exit out to the main menu if you've seen enough.


== Image and Text Positioning ==
*Warning - this section is under development and may not be entirely accurate yet!*

In the FoFiX game engine, images are positioned (anchored) by their exact center. Text is positioned (anchored) by it's upper left corner, with a small margin.  

One quirk of this; fonts are positioned by relative coordinates between 0.0 and 1.0.  However, the scale is EQUAL for both width and height of the screen.  
Examples:
 * Font position (x, y) = (0.0, 0.0) will write text starting in the upper left corner of the screen.
 * Font position (x, y) = (1.0, 0.0) will attempt to write text starting in the upper *RIGHT* corner of the screen, and no text will be visible as it starts at the right edge and continues right.
 * Font position (x, y) = (0.0, 0.75) will attempt to write text starting at the *LOWER* left corner of the screen, which will not be visible due to the text displaying down and to the right of it's given position.
 * Font position (x, y) = (1.0, 0.75) will attempt to write text starting at the *LOWER RIGHT* corner of the screen, and no text will be visible as it starts at both the right AND bottom edges and continues down and right.
