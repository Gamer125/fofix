#summary Brief instructions to get members started.

= Introduction =

Ensure you are logged into GoogleCode, then...

Go here:
[http://code.google.com/p/fofix/source/checkout]

Look for this line:
svn checkout https://fofix.googlecode.com/svn/MFH-Mod/trunk/ fofix --username <<your username here>>

Use everything after "svn checkout" as your SVN checkout address.  You may need to check out a fresh copy of FoFiX using this member-only checkout address.

Click on the googlecode password link, slightly below that.  It should take you here:
[http://code.google.com/hosting/settings]

This is what you will use for your password when prompted.  Your username will be whatever it says after "--username " in the above svn checkout line.

Then, an SVN Update.  Then an SVN Commit to commit new changes.  Type a log entry to describe what this commit does, then press OK.  Should work fine.


Always update before you commit!  This will notify you if someone has just committed code that changes an area you are working on; hopefully everything merges nicely when you update.
