==Patch install instructions==
First, be sure you have one of the 3.000 releases (I recommend the Rock Band release). Download the latest patch and extract it to the game folder (where !FretsOnFire.exe and the data folder are). This should mainly copy a new data\library.zip over your original, as well as any additional support files required over the last major release. Then you are ready to play!

Each patch comes with a blank fretsonfire.ini for *MAXIMUM COMPATIBILITY*. You may choose to keep your old fretsonfire.ini so you do not have to re-set all your settings. However, if you encounter problems or bugs then the *FIRST THING* you have to try is a *BLANK* fretsonfire.ini file!

*IMPORTANT* Use [http://www.rarlab.com/ WinRar 3.70+] or equivalent to read the .RAR compressed archives properly.

*PLEASE NOTE* if you cannot even get a basic version of Frets on Fire working, this mod will not fix your problem. Furthermore, I will not help you get the game working. There are plenty of other support threads on this forum that can help you troubleshoot. Once you have a basic version of FoF working, then you are ready to try this mod.
