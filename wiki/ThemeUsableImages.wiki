#summary List of Usable Images for FoFiX Themes.

<wiki:comment>
What I wouldn't give for a WYSIWYG editor...
I recommend copy-pasting all this text into a text editor (with monospaced font and option to turn off word wrapping) if you intend to edit this

=Images Usable By FoFiX=

This will be a complete list of usable images that FoFiX can use.
It will list what directory they belong in, and if they are Required or if they are just usable if they exist.
An image is marked required if FoFiX crashes/freezes when the file is not present. Sometimes files are only required for specific theme types.
As at the time of writing there are 4 main theme types: RB, GH2, GH3 and GH:WT. Anything marked "GH Based" means it falls into all of GH2, GH3 and GH:WT (i.e., everything but RB)
This is WIP status until completed. Then it will just me maintained as things are added.
