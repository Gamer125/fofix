[i]Long-term: (low priority / background progress)[/i]
[/color]
[color=grey]
-Create a 3-player mode
--Create a third set of player keys / alternate keys
-Add optional flashing sidebars on neck when SP is ready
-Look into the feasibility of creating a font rendering queueing function, so all the font.render() functions will queue up and then at the end of the guitarscene.render() it will give the command to render all queued text as efficiently as possible
-Add a setting to the main game options to enable / disable "Advanced Settings" - create an new set of a couple user-friendly settings (such as Volume, Theme, Animated Stage, Choose Neck, Advanced Mode, and Credits) for when this is disabled
-Enhance the concept of "Alternate" keysets, instead of just "Normal" and "Alternate" - make this an integer, and allow up to 4 key sets (which will be easily expandable).
-Replace all Decimal object quantization with modulo formatting, which can specify the number of decimal places to display (without rounding, which will work better to show thresholds)
--which also needs to involve an update to the "Decimal Places" setting and how it is handled
-Add support for a new star graphic for a star score of 7 in-game (gold stars with an aura?  3D-looking extruded gold stars?  whatever - just something different...)
-Add support for a new star graphic for a star score of 7 in the songlist score & game results score (something different...)
-Check out [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?sharekey=3b3779e0aeba7433d2db6fb9a8902bda]11111's proposed FoF intro video #1[/url] and [url=http://www.mediafire.com/?descsg1yht9]video #2[/url], and look into adding an optional intro video (default On) to the FoF startup sequence.
-Rewrite all sound loading logic to support optional random choices with single sound fallback (example: starpower.ogg = fallback, starpower1.ogg starpower2.ogg = random choices) with any number of random choices for each sound
-Add support for each stage folder to have an .ini file containing intended rotation order and delay settings
-Add new control key to allow real-time selection (via cycling) of available Killswitch effects
--...(during gameplay, without pausing) - i.e., start with analog killswitch, press "select", BAM you're using digital killswitch.  Press "select" again and... analog killswitch
-Add functions to career songlist "Career Backup" and "Career Restore" to support basic juggling of multiple careers (each "career" will include an unlock code for each difficulty)
-Add "Reset Scores" function to the bottom of Quickplay mode songlists, which will reset scores of all songs in the current folder (NOT recursively)
--Add submenu to Reset Scores function, just a simple confirmation dialog ("Are you sure you want to reset all scores for songs in this list?")
-Add submenu / confirmation to Reset Career function, allow user to choose: (1)reset scores + unlock status, (2)reset unlock status only (keep scores), or (3)cancel / reset nothing
-Locate a copy (or a better clone) of [url=http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/underware/fakir_regular_ot/]this font[/url] for use in the Rock Band theme
-Rewrite guitar/bass note rendering logic so that the notes can be rendered in reverse order for correct close note overlaps (like drums) without breaking tail logic
-Add support for animated stages that are not theme-specific (data\Stages\)
-Either add width scaling or more static killswitch tail states for analog killswitch mode [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=24664;st=5210#entry316091]one suggestion[/url]
-Create a separate pause submenu for Career mode that does not include Jurgen options
-Figure out how to force compile error logfile to save to "FoF-CompileErrors.log" instead of the confusing "FretsOnFire.exe.log" name
-Add optional support for a separated "crowd.ogg" audio track; with settings "Disabled", "On all the time", and "On during SP only"
-Fix Jurgen logic so Pro-Face-Off mode fails him just like a human player (disables his controls, etc): [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST;f=11;t=24664;st=3640#entry292306]detail post[/url]
-Create a persistant songlist object, to prevent re-instantiation and memory leak
-Add secondary / duplicate guitar fret buttons with navigation for Rock Band guitars
-Add option to show graphical selections (like main menu buttons) for instrument
-Add option to show graphical selections (like main menu buttons) for difficulty
-[i]Changes that will affect scoring will have to be handled differently, for details see [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=690#entry246608]this post[/url][/i]
--Enhance score uploading logic [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=280#entry242813]as in these 2 posts[/url] so score charts can correctly track gold stars separately from Full Combos, and separate GH2 Sloppy & GH2 Strict scores
--Try to make scoring as accurate as possible according to [url=http://www.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=378]this post[/url]
-Write logic to recalculate total number of notes to not include notes before start position - for practice mode's accuracy & note counts
-Figure out how to cram [url=http://i33.tinypic.com/28w0848.jpg]this graphic[/url] into a TTF so I can use it for Rock Band lyrics...
-Rewrite neck image detection logic to allow for any neck filenames, and store neck filename instead of neck number
-Display the longest note streak in parentheses in-game
-Force 2-decimal place average multiplier rounding to match the full accuracy display [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=420#entry243857]problem discussed here[/url]
-In rockband theme, do not make 2 rock meter bars, only one and have both arrows on it (2 player CO-OP mode, combined score like RB)
-Add user option to completely disable graphical multipliers and just use text as in Bass Groove
-Add user option to use a starpowerneckovr.png (or overdriveneckovr.png) for a starpower / overdrive neck overlay
-Write separate logic to handle individual player's "You Rock" status; right now, if one player makes it to the end of the song, both players "Rock."
-Add code to use separate DrumKeys.png if present, so we can use Wolferacing's drum keys
-Attempt to add another audio track for rhythm guitar (separate from bass guitar)
-Add wide bassdrumhitflames1.png and bassdrumhitflames2.png support for bass drum hits, properly scaled and positioned
-Port Hering's song queue / merged difficulty & part selection screen
-Create a phantom difficulty filter so that the game will not show you difficulties with 5 or less notes in them.
-Add [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=2420#entry227856]hit accuracy average, total error score, etc. review at end of song[/url]
-Add drum fill sections, with required green fret / cymbal hit at end to continue streak (or maybe to activate starpower instead) - [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=2850#entry231947]detail post[/url]
---Add option to use the separate drum fill drum sounds as miss sounds, instead of the random sounds
-Add support for RB2 drum solos without breaking the guitar solo system
-Add support for RB2 bass solos without breaking the guitar solo system
-Allow theme-based necks; if there is a "necks" folder in a theme, then those necks will be used.  If not, data\necks will be used.
-Move all text and graphic positioning elements into the theme.ini so it is easier to code custom themes - [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=20933&st=2920#entry232509]detail post[/url]
-Give Jurgen the (in)ability to play worse... allow user to select Jurgen's "skill" level to compete against
--Also add a small Jurgen score display to the game results so you can compare your score and streak against his
----And have Jurgen talk trash to you or praise you depending on the score gap
-Add function to read in manual starpower section markings from MIDI file instead of automatic calculation, and do something with big rock ending parts:

-Add support for Loading, You Rock, and You Fail animations - just a couple frames of PNG files
-Add capability for main menu submenu's "last" settings to be retained and selected by default the next time they are navigated
- Add the ability to have different menus for Difficulty (Default), Instrument, Selection select, with a fallback on default.
- Add the ability to have a different set of menus for Career, Quick Play (Default), Multiplayer, and Practice, with a fallback on default.
- Separate the results screen and the high score, with a fallback on the Results.
- Add the ability to have a different results screen for Multiplayer, with a fallback on the default one.
- Change the Pause and Fail screen to make them so they stretch to the full size of the screen (Make it easier to see how it would look in-game when editing).
- Add the ability to have a different Training screen, with a fallback on the Options.
- Add a neck folder to each theme, and add an option to have either Custom necks, or Theme necks.
- Add a practice neck to the neck folder that only gets used during Practice & Tutorial mode, that gets filtered out during regular play.
- Add a neck angle option to theme.ini and a option called Theme.
- Add a neck width option to theme.ini and add a option for Thene, and other pre-set ones.
- Make the high score scroll appear above the Contine, Replay, and Quit options, instead of starting at the bottom and going behind it.
- Add support for graphical Game Mode select screens  -- [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=4930#entry310665]detail post[/url]
- Change the dots in the GH2 mod so 1-10 are yellow, 10 making it x2, 11-20 are green, 20 being x3, 21-30 being purple, 30 being x4, and stop the dots from adding up anymore, leaving all the dots colored purple.
-Add a 3rd option to "Song List", along with "List and "CD" : "List with CD" (basically, it'd be like "List", but CD cases would appear in the place of the skull from "selected.png")
-Add songlist display mode "All" to ignore folder and career structures and just list / sort all songs in one list
-Add logic to pause the game when it loses focus (when another application demands attention with a pop-up and switches out of FoF) -- [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=4800#entry309254]detail post[/url]

-Add a special position below all other necks for the "random" neck, so at any point browsing through other necks the user can just press down for random - [url=http://www.fretsonfire.net/cgi-bin/ikonboard.cgi?act=ST&f=11&t=24664&st=4830#entry309728]detail post[/url]
-Add Boss Battles to Career mode (with Jurgen at a certain skill level playing the other part, displaying the guitarist name "is here" instead of Jurgen, and you must defeat him to continue)
