1)Year

To have it show the year the song was made/published add

year =

at the end of the song.ini.  Make sure to put a number by it.  If it is not defined it will not appear.

2)Custom Loading Phrase

To have it show a loading phrase custom to the song put

loading_phrase = 

at the end of the song.ini (after year if you have year defined).  Currently it does not allow multiple phrases, only one.  If it is not defined it will use the ones defined if the theme.ini, if those are not defined it will use the default.


Good luck,

other song.ini supported settings:

tags = cover
^^^ will show "as made famous by" instead of "as performed by" during the song countdown

artist = .38 Special <-- Of course, indicates that the artist is ".38 Special"
name = Hold On Loosely <-- Of course, indicates that the song name is "Hold On Loosely"
tags = cover <--- Indicates that is not an original master. So it will show "As Made famous by" instead of "As performed by" at the beginning of the song.
unlock_id = gh80_3 <--- For career mode, indicates the Tier it belongs to.
unlock_require = gh80_2enc <-- For career mode, indicates the unlock_id of the songs you have to complete to be able to play this song.
unlock_text = Finish Tier 2 Encore To Unlock <--- This is a text that is displayed when the song is locked and you try to select it.
cassettecolor = #000000 <--- The colour of the cassete/CD
count = 1 <--- Times played
scores = <--- Encoded HighScores
scores_ext = <--Also Encoded, contains other score info (longest note streak, etc)
"year =" <--- year in which the song has been published/made
"tutorial =" <--- boolean value -- not checked, but chances are it tells the game not to display the song in the Set list if set to 1.
"delay =" <--- not sure; IINM makes the notes appear earlier/later (depending on the value -- that could be set in ms but that's a random guess).
"frets =" <--- name of the maker/converter of the song.
"loading_phrase =" <--- should be put at the end of the file; displays a custom phrase (maybe more than 1, if separated by "_", but I haven't tested) on the loading screen, instead of the selected theme's default ones.
version = <--- show the version of the song.
